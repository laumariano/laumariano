## Hey, good? 👋🏻

My name is Laura, but you can call me Lau, I'm Brazilian and Law student at UniSR.

📊 I'm passionate about data science and I'm always looking for new ways of learning. 
Use Python as your primary language to develop machine learning models.

⭐ Sharing knowledge and learning with other people, that's why I created Instagram **@datawithlau**.
